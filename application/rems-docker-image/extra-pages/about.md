## Australian Genomics Datasets

### Cardiovascular Disorders

#### `urn:fdc:australiangenomics:2022:ds/cardio`

The Cardiovascular Disorders project is investigating genetic links to
three types of heart conditions:
congenital heart disease, arrhythmia disorders and cardiomyopathies.
With the support of the Australian Government’s Medical Research Future Fund,
it is enrolling up to 600 participants from across the
country to undergo testing using whole genome sequencing techniques.

### Leukodystrophy flagship – Massimo’s Mission

#### `urn:fdc:australiangenomics:2022:ds/massimo`

Massimo’s Mission is a comprehensive, multi-disciplinary research
study working to ‘close the loop’ from genetic diagnoses through
to clinical treatment of leukodystrophies. The study has been
enabled by a $3 million grant from the Australian
Government’s Medical Research Future Fund and
builds on Australian Genomics’ previous Leukodystrophy research.

### Mackenzie’s Mission

The Australian Reproductive Genetic Carrier Screening study
Mackenzie’s Mission is a research project offering reproductive
genetic carrier screening to thousands of Australian couples
who are either planning to have children or are in early pregnancy.
It gives couples information about their
likelihood of having a child with a severe genetic condition.
